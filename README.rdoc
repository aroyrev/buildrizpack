= BuildrIzPack

A buildr plugin contributing a new packaging method to package your project as a IzPack installer.

This is for Buildr, the build system that lets you build like you code. see http://buildr.apache.org/

Some ideas/naming conventions were picked up from https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-izpack-plugin.

== Getting Started

This plugin provides a one-stop solution for packaging, distributing and deploying applications for the Java platform using IzPack (http://izpack.org/). Before using it, install it via

  gem install BuildrIzPack

== Useages

There are the following different useages.

1. Include one or more files and let the BuildrIzPack build a simple installer, where you may choose the installation path. Default langues is 'eng'. The locales accepts an array of locale-identifiers (3-letters ISO code) 

2. Specifiy a IzPack installer-XML via the the input methods
3. Specify the XML-content of the various elements of the IzPack installation

===  Example 1

include one or more files and let the BuildrIzPack build a simple installer

  require 'buildrizpack'
  Buildr::write "myProject/src/main/java/Hello.java", "public class Hello {}"
  define 'myProject' do
    package(:jar)
    package(:izpack).locales = ['eng', 'fra', 'deu']
    package(:izpack).include(package(:jar))
  end

=== Example 2

Specifiy a IzPack installer-XML via the the input methods

  require 'buildrizpack'
  define 'myProject' do
    package(:jar)
    # It is you responsability to specify correctly all dependencies!!
    package(:izpack).input = path_to(:sources, :main, :ressources, 'myInstaller.xml')
    package(:izpack)
  end

=== Example 3

Specify the XML-content

  require 'buildrizpack'
  Buildr::write "myProject/src/main/java/Hello.java", "public class Hello {}"
  define 'myProject' do
    package(:jar)
    package(:izpack).locales = ['eng', 'fra', 'deu']
    package(:izpack).include(package(:jar))
  end

== Living On the Edge

You can check the latest sources via:

  git clone git://github.com/ngiger/buildrizpack

To install BuildrIzPack locally from source:

  cd buildrizpack
  rake install

If the cutting edge doesn't work, make sure to check the CHANGELOG, to see
which changes might have broken your build.  To run all the test cases:

  rake spec
